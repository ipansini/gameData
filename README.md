# gameData
In this Project of Mine I use txt file called gameData. In this data it has the Home Team, Away Team, Game Number, Home Score, Away Score, and a True or False if it is a Tie By using this data we can read through it and make a table from every game played to find who is the winner of the leauge, the team with the largest winning percentage, and also we found the team with the largest goal differential
I hope you enjoy this program it was alot of fun to write!
